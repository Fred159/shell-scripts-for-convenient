# Shell-scripts-for-convenient(environemtn: ubutnu16.04)
Several shell scripts. The reason why make this repository is, it is too complex to install programs...
So I try to make a convinient file( or collected command which with already valided). 
Although this file I call it as shell, but some of these files only can be used as command line text....
But I think maybe it will help to some peolple who like me
